## 🎓 Boosting Student Engagement with Analytics

A data-driven case study analyzing the effectiveness of TABot, a smart study assistant used in a university setting. We investigated how engagement impacts academic performance and developed targeted recommendations using segmentation, visual insights, and behavior modeling.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

TABot helps students stay organized through reminders, study plans, and a chatbot interface. But does it truly impact learning outcomes?

---

## 🔍 What We Did

- Segmented students into:
  - Users vs. Non-Users
  - Active vs. Inactive Users
  - High vs. Low Performers
- Assessed differences in:
  - Assignment scores
  - Test scores
  - GPA
  - Canvas pageviews & submissions

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **TABot users outperform non-users** on most academic metrics
- **High activity users** had significantly better outcomes than inactive users
- Students tend to **lose interest** mid-semester → retention challenge
- Identified **four user archetypes** based on performance and activity

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### 1. Data-Driven Personalization
- Custom study plans for low performers
- Personalized nudges and emails for inactive students

### 2. Gamification

- Use a reactive mascot ("Gopher Moods") and leaderboard-based challenges

### 3. UI/UX Improvements
- Improve chatbot responsiveness
- Enhance dashboard with progress tracking and personalized tips
